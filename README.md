PetCare-Booking-App
Overview

PetCare-Booking-App is a React Single Page Application (SPA) built with Vite.
It was developed as my Final Project for INFO6150 Web Design at Northeastern University.

The app simulates a professional pet care booking platform, where users can explore services, view information, and book appointments.
It demonstrates best practices in responsive web design, accessibility (WCAG), and component-based React development.

Features
✅ Multi-page SPA navigation (Home, Services, Booking, Information)
✅ Responsive design with adaptive breakpoints (360px → 1200px)
✅ Accessible navigation (semantic HTML, skiplink, aria-labels, alt text)
✅ Booking form with validation (input limitations, required fields)
✅ Custom color palette and consistent design system
✅ Cards, dropdown menus, and adaptive hamburger navigation
✅ Organized project structure (src/components, src/styles, etc.)
